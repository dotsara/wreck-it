# Why is my editor broken?

Recently, I updated my `~/.gitconfig` to change my editor from the long-standing TextMate to VSCode (since it's the editor I use for work, now). 

Except when I changed `editor = mate` to `editor = code`, I couldn't rebase anymore. When the file opened in VSCode, I just see a blank screen.

So, I changed it back to `editor = mate`, but that doesn't work, now, _either_. 

_SUPER_ ðŸ˜•

My mission is to figure out wtf happenedâ€¦Â
