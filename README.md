*Update 15-July-2016*   
Still wrecking things in git! :grinning: But now I'm mostly making notes over in [issues](../../issues) as a breadcrumb trail. Feel free to add your own busted-then-fixed situations! :sparkles:

I'm gonna wreck it!
========

For a long time: when I encountered merge conflicts and non-fast-forward errors with git at work, my SOP was to freak. right. out.
<br /><img src="http://31.media.tumblr.com/8f7dd48d0dc4b3003a0e2b866ccd84f8/tumblr_mk66o4f5Aw1r1thdeo1_500.gif" width="250" border="0" alt="noooo" />

And in past-me's defense, 99% of the time this had zero impact on anyone else, so my preferred solution of blowing away the branch and starting over worked just fine. Of course, I finally accepted this was kind of a terrible way to behave—or anyway, it wouldn't scale—and decided to teach myself more productive responses to  `branchname|CONFLICT`.

I made a repo at work where I set about trying to _induce_ the errors and weirdo messages that make me so nervous. It worked really well! (I even had a rebase-squash that put me through 5 rounds of merge conflicts _like a champ_.) And then I deleted the repo.

Way to go, me! …

So I'm doing it again in the name of practice and with the hope that perhaps it'll be useful to someone else as well.
